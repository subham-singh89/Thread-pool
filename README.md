ThreadPool Example

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a thread pool in C++. A thread pool manages a fixed number of threads and distributes tasks to them asynchronously, providing efficient task execution in concurrent environments.
Usage

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ThreadPoolExample.git
cd ThreadPoolExample

Build the Project:

Ensure you have CMake installed. Build the project using the following commands:

bash

cmake .
make

Run the Example:

Execute the compiled executable to see the thread pool in action:

bash

    ./ThreadPoolExample

    This will run the example application, which demonstrates how tasks are processed concurrently by the thread pool.
